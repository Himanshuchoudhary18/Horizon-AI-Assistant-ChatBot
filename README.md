# Question-Answering-Assistant-ChatBot
This project demonstrates an interactive, responsive chatbot to engage users through an intuitive drag-and-drop conversation flow, interactive elements (buttons, quick replies, menus), and responsive design adaptable to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
Although the current version is trained on a small dataset—which may limit its ability to answer some questions—it implements strategies such as fallback responses and plans for iterative data enhancement to improve performance over time.

Features
Interactive Conversational Flow: Leverages Bolt.new’s visual interface for designing dynamic conversation paths.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various devices with built-in preview tools.
Customizable UI: Easily modify color schemes, fonts, and branding elements to align with your website.
AI Integration: Uses natural language processing to understand and respond to user intents.
Fallback and Escalation: Provides graceful degradation with fallback messages and options for human handoff when necessary.
Future Data Expansion: Includes strategies for dataset augmentation and continuous learning to enhance answer accuracy.
