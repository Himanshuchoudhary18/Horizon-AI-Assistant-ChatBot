  },
  {
    question: "Explain dependency injection",
    answer: "Dependency Injection is a design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. This promotes loose coupling, makes code more testable, and improves maintainability by separating object creation from business logic."
  },

  // Database
  {
    question: "What is SQL vs NoSQL?",
    answer: "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language and predefined schemas (like MySQL, PostgreSQL). NoSQL databases are non-relational and offer flexible schemas (like MongoDB, Redis).

  },

  // Software Testing
  {
    question: "What is unit testing?",
    answer: "Unit testing is a software testing method where individual components or units of code are tested in isolation. It helps ensure that each part of the program works correctly independently. Unit tests are typically automated and run as part of the development process."
  },
  {
    question: "Explain TDD",
    answer: "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The cycle includes writing a failing test, writing code to pass the test, and then refactoring. This ensures code quality and helps maintain clear requirements."
  },

  // Modern Web Technologies
  {
    question: "What is WebAssembly?",

  },
  {
    question: "Explain caching",
    answer: "Caching is a technique of storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage system (cache) to reduce database load and improve application performance. Common caching strategies include in-memory caching, browser caching, and CDN caching."
  },

  // JavaScript & Frontend
  {
    question: "What is the event loop in JavaScript?",
    answer: "The event loop is a core concept in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and callback queue, moving callbacks to the stack when it's empty. This enables non-blocking I/O operations and maintains JavaScript's single-threaded nature while handling concurrent operations."
  },
  {
    question: "Explain React hooks",
    answer: "React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.
